<p>Grabs natural landscape images from Reddit and sets them as your wallpapers. Their geolocations are then saved using Google API.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Trending Reddit submissions on (SFW) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/" target="_blank">r/EarthPorn</a> (SFW) are grabbed using PRAW.</li>
  <li>The image is then saved to the user's computer, and their desktop wallpaper is set.</li>
  <li>Based on the submission title, the location is searched for using Google API, retrying for different combinations if the search fails.</li>
  <li>A list of user selected locations is built and saved as a JSON for further use.</li>
</ol>
