      <p>Haven't updated this site in awhile. But figured it's time to keep this
        updated as it's job hunting time. Current goals for this upcoming new year
        are:
        <ul>
          <li>Apply, apply, apply</li>
          <li>Worry, worry, worry</li>
          <li>Try to get one of my projects finished and up on GitHub</li>
          <li>Clean this site up, add some more functionality (but what?)</li>
          <li>Try to finish some of my Steam backlog</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <p>Finals are over, and adulthood is fast approaching. Currently
      in the hospital as my dad lies in his hospital bed; he's doing
      okay, will see tomorrow if has to get surgery or not.
      Website is still a bit messy; Pong game isn't finished,
      and the website is still plenty HTML/CSS. I start working
      full-time next week, but I feel like I need to prepare so much
      for interviews. Busy, busy, busy.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Second post!</h3>
      <p>I believed I finished the "Resume" section of the website last night (or early this morning),
        at least version 1.0 at least. The next goal is to flesh out the Home/Blog and Personal
        portions of the site, to at least be functional. Originally I had planned to do some AngularJS
        that would control how the blog posts would appear, but for now it will just be some
        HTML/CSS blocks.</p>
      <p>Future goals (not in any particular order):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flesh out Home/Personal section (this Home might be close to done now actually)</li>
        <li>Begin working on a project -- ideas so far include a browser game</li>
        <li>Start Projects section of the site once a project has some progress made</li>
        <li>Homework lol</li>
        <li>Set up a domain now that the website is coming together</li>
      </ul>
