<p>Create computer art by dividing an image into quadrants.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The image is divided into quadrants, with the mean value calculated per quadrant.</li>
  <li>Each quadrant is then divided into quadrants again, with the mean squared error calculated per sub-quadrant.</li>
  <li>Quadrants with the highest error are divided further, and this continues for the number of iterations provided by the user.</li>
</ol>
